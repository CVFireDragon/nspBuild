# nspBuild
Community Mod of rkk's nspBuild

Convert NCA to NSP Format using Python

# Note:
This tool is just for packing NCAs into NSP and it doesn't touch NCAs (if they don't run, it's not this tool's fault, just NCAs don't pass switch checks or they are corrupted)

# Documentation
This tool takes your NCA file and changes the header to a PFS0 format (also changes a few other things), then builds an NSP file from the changes it made.

# Usage
1. Download the compiled executable file (exe), or Python script (py)

2. Open CMD in the py/exe's directory and run ``nspBuild output (replace with nca) (replace with the same directory as the nca, with test.nsp at the end)``

Example: ``nspBuild output C:\Directory\FileName.nca C:\Directory\Test.nsp``

(obviously, replace the ()'s with whatever it says to)
