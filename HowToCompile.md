Then, right click compile_first-time.bat and Run As Administrator (seen below)

Once that finishes, press any key when it says to.

It's built! Now just open the "Dist" folder and there is your .exe!

(Note: Run compile.bat after running compile_first-time.bat when you want to build again.)

# Note

If you don't want to do any of this, every release from now on has the .exe file.
